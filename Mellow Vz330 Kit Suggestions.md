# Mellow Fly Kit Sugges0ons VzBot 330 Kit (July 2023 Build)

## Installing Corner Brackets

M4 screws are intended here, but heads are too small.

Proposed solution:

* Include M4 Washers
* Or, provide 12 addi0onal m5x10 BHCS screws with Tnuts

## Z Assembly- M3x45’s were needed but not included.

Proposed solution:

* Provide a quantity of 4 M3x45’s SCHS

## Heat Inserts will be needed throughout the build (including toolhead, and other loca0ons)

Proposed solution:

* Include a bag of small M3 heat inserts (3x4mm)

## Toolhead requires 2 M3x30 screws that go inside spacers that were not included.

Proposed solution:

* Include 2 M3x30 screws

## AC Inlet is not of sufficient quality.

Proposed solution:

* Consider providing a "US" version of the AC inlet, with proper IEC wiring colors and a 10A fuse option, rather than the included 5A which is probably fine for Europe but not US (since we have half the voltage of EU, so need double the current).

## Back Panel

I ran out of M4x10 screws

Proposed solution:

* Include an additional 20 M4x10 BHCS

## Feet (Assuming Stock feet)

Proposed solution:

* Include 4 M4x25 SCHS length screws for installing rubber feet
* Include 8 M4x20 SCHS length screws for remaining feet screws

## Super 8 Board Mounting

Proposed solution:

* Include M3x8 SHCS (quantity at least 10)

## Electronics Connectors

Proposed solution:

* Only spade terminals for Super 8 Pro board are included in kit.
* Include proper sized Spade terminals for 24v and 48v power supply. Recommend at least a 20 pack. (3 for AC input x 2, 6 spaces for +/- x2 on 24v and 48v).
* Include a pack of assorted ferrules for 5160 motor connectors and hot end heater

## Wiring

Proposed solution:

* Include heat shrink that can accommodate 20-24 awg wiring, used for endstops
* Include zip 0es
* Include 6mm and 12mm braided sleeve for keeping back panel wiring 0dy, and for toolhead wire loom / umbilical

## CPAP

Proposed solution:

* Include M2x6 self-tapping screws for CPAP board mount

## Exhaust Fan

Proposed solution:

* Kit was missing 4x M4x50’s. Include those.

## RSCS & Side Panels

Proposed solution:

* Kit was missing m5x12 self-tapping screws. Instead it included M4. I used heat inserts for the fans with M3 screws and washers as a substitute. Recommend including the M5x12 self-tapping screws.
* Side panel install required a significant amount of M4x10 screws, and at this point I didn’t have any left. Recommend including at least another 20-30 M4x10’s. At this point I think we’re up to 40 missing M4x10’s.

## Front Panels

Proposed solution:

* 4 Heat inserts needed for latches. Include a small bag of heat inserts.
