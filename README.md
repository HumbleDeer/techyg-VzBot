# VzBot
Repository for VZbot mods and info as I go through my build. 

Information:

* https://github.com/techyg/VzBot/blob/main/2020%20Endcap%20-%20Mellow%20Fly%20330%20Remix.stl The stock parts for the 2020 covers are too long and hit the bolt. I created a remix, 2020 Endcap - Mellow Fly 330 Remix.stl that will work with the Mellow Fly extrusion. You will need to print 8 of these.
