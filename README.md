# Printed Parts

2020 Endscap - Mellow Fly 330 Remix.stl: The stock parts for the 2020 covers are too long and hit the bolt. I created the remix that will work with the Mellow Fly extrusion. You will need to print 8 of these.

VzHextrudort_Motor_Spacer_v1.stl: This helps insulate the motor the heat. I ran into an issue where my motor was causing lower temp filament (PETG) to deform/clog in the extruder due to excessive heat. This is only .5mm thick- print this at a low layer height (.1mm is what I used). 

# Config & Slicer Files

This folder includes all of the printer.cfg and related files that I use. Files are all based on the "stock" VzBot configuration.
