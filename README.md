Repository for VZbot mods and info as I go through my build. 

Information:

* My initial impressions of the Mellow Fly Kit after getting it up and running and doing a few prints below. This document also includes links to additional components that you may need for your build.

*** The kit also has several missing fasteners and room for improvement. ** This is not a comprehensive list, but will give you an idea of what additional components you may need to purchase for your kit. I list the missing fastners here as well as some other suggestions for improving the kit.

* 2020 Endscap - Mellow Fly 330 Remix.stl: The stock parts for the 2020 covers are too long and hit the bolt. I created the remix that will work with the Mellow Fly extrusion. You will need to print 8 of these.
