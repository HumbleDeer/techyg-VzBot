Here you find all the files that I am using for my "mostly stock" Mellow VZBot 330 printer, which includes the following:

* Super 8 Pro board
* Goliath Hot End with stock heater cartridge, 24v fan, Generic 3950 Thermistor because my Mellow Fly one broke during install.
* 5160 external stepper motors for X, X1, Y, Y1 run at 48v; single 2209 drivers for E and Z at 24v.
* 750 Watt AC Bed
* Limit switches for X, Y, Z
* CPAP Cooling fan wired to Super 8
* Exhaust fan, RSCS Fans. I am using an external MOSFET to power the RSCS fan due to the higher amp draw. 
* Include file for Provok3d nozzle board. (Optional)
